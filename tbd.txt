
//ui- better cards showing all details etc. gg. 
//need to add form validations alert messages etc.



UX
//sign in while its signing in-loading screen.
//sign in failed.-screen message.
//sign in- email already exists
//login loading screen while loggin gin.
//all loading screens

//logout-delete session


Issues
1) If u put at 10:45am for tmrw mroning at night 9pm ,It wont show so create a seperate section called all meds added for all-
 in that section only u can delete update etc also
2) Scenario

Login on PC → token A stored

Login on Phone → token B stored (overwrites A)

Result:

Only the last logged-in device receives notifications


The other device becomes silent

3) delete med after the set dose date.
